CSC525 // Computer Graphics // Project 1

Contributors: Zackh Tucker // Josiah McGurty

This repo has been set up for my group to work on Project 1. 

Project 1 is the culmination of the first half of the semester's work, 
combining all of the lab work we have done so far into one single project. 

We are implementing 
    Text
    Bitmaps
    Stippled line segments
    Circle algorithms
    Pattern filled polygons
    Pixel maps
all using GLUT // OpenGL.

CPP file can be compliled by command line using g++, or by adding the file to 
a blank Visual Studio project. The latter is what we are using for this class. 

Might have to make a change in VS to compile:
Configuration Properties>>C/C++>>Preporocessor>>Preprocessor Definitions>> _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
